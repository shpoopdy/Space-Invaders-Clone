# Intro
This is my version of the space invaders clone that we made for CS 232 Pythong Programming.
For this assingment I learned to work with pygame to create a window and screen, which I 
populated with images and created the logic for how the invaders should behave at certain points.
My version included a boss that did not go to lower levels, but was to be protected by the other 
invaders as his health became lower.

# How to Play
The rules are similar to Space Invaders, the difference here is the boss on the top of the window.
Use the left & right arrows to move and use the up arrow to fire you laser. The game ends when the 
boss's health is zero or an invader makes it to the bottom.
